# Scripts
All the code to be deployed to the Raspberry Pi goes in this folder, and set up to run at boot, with GUI support.


## Project Folders:
- The project is divided up into folders.
- The old GUI project is no longer being developed, and is being stored in the GUI folder.
- The new AutoRead project is split into three areas.
### AutoRead
The original project origin - this reads Simotion automation data, and minor edits are made.
### AutoRead Track
Part 1 of 2 new sub projects. This does maths to calculate azimuth and elevation, from two cartesian co-ordinates.
### AutoRead Control
Part 2 of 2 new sub projects. This outputs sACN to a network, which is interpreted by ETC Net3 node, and controls lights, to follow direction from AutoRead Track.

## Files:
- axis_list.txt - generated by axis_list_generator.py, it just creates a flat file to read some dummy data from.
- axis_list_generator.py - see above.
- demo_static.py - displays static information for general publicity. Defines CLI output for ../read.py
