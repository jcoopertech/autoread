# Scripts
All the code to be deployed to the Raspberry Pi goes in this folder, and set up to run at boot, with GUI support.

## Files:
- axis_list.txt - generated by axis_list_generator.py, it just creates a flat file to read some dummy data from.
- axis_list_generator.py - see above.
- demo_static.py - displays static information for general publicity. Defines CLI output for ../read.py
