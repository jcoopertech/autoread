# Contributing
If you're reading this, I guess you'd like to contribute to the project!

Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot you can do without physically being in the development environment, without setting the environment up yourself.
That said, if you're really intrigued, I can send you network packet files to play around with, if you can set up a virtual network.

## How you can help
I'd love some help developing the Tkinter interface - this is something that I'm really not sure about, and will take a lot of time for me I think.
I think you can do this by forking the project and just going for it... pulling it back into this project proably won't happen, I'll be honest - as the code has to be my own work, but I'd count your input as research, and credit it appropriately.

You're more than welcome to reach out and we can discuss this in detail.

# Footnotes
This is my first Git/GitHub based project, if you've got any hints/tips/tricks as to using this platform to it's full potential, I'd love to hear it!
